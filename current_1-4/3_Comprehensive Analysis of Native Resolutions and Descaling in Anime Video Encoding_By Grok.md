### Comprehensive Analysis of Native Resolutions and Descaling in Anime Video Encoding

Based on a deep review of all provided documents (e.g., kageru.moe.md, kbz12.pdf, HTML snapshots of blogs and guides) and the linked resources (browsed via tools, including guides, Anibin examples, and GitHub tools), this analysis synthesizes the key concepts, methods, tools, examples, evolution of techniques, and practical considerations for handling native resolutions in upscaled anime sources. The information spans from early 2010s blog posts to modern (2020s) tools and guides, showing a progression from manual scripting to automated, fractional-aware detection.

The core idea is that most anime (especially TV series) is produced at sub-1080p resolutions (e.g., 720p, 810p, 846p) but upscaled to 1080p for Blu-ray releases. Descaling reverses this upscale to restore the "native" resolution, enabling smaller file sizes, better compression, and potentially higher quality when upscaled by the viewer's player (e.g., using MadVR). However, incorrect descaling can introduce artifacts like ringing, aliasing, or haloing, so visual verification is essential.

#### 1. Key Concepts and Theory
- **Native Resolution Definition**: The resolution at which content was originally produced (filmed, drawn, or animated). For anime, this is often below 1080p due to production constraints. Upscaling adds no new detail but increases file size and processing demands. Restoring native res saves bandwidth/storage and allows better consumer-side upscaling.
  - From kbz12.pdf: Native res is the pre-upscale state; reversing "cheap" upscales (e.g., bilinear) can yield subjectively better results.
  - Common natives: 720p (1280x720), 810p (1440x810), 846p (1504x846), 864p (1536x864), 900p (1600x900). Fractional examples (e.g., 955.5p from Kyoto Animation) arise from upscaling to 1088p then cropping to 1080p (per Anibin post).

- **Upscaling Kernels**: Algorithms used for interpolation during upscale. Common in anime:
  - Bilinear: Simple, soft; often used for 720p upscales.
  - Bicubic: Sharper; variants defined by parameters b and c (e.g., b=0, c=1 for sharp; b=1/3, c=1/3 for Mitchell-Netravali; b=0, c=0.5 for Catmull-Rom). Follows b + 2c = 1 often.
  - Others: Lanczos (taps=3+), Spline16/36, B-Spline (b=1, c=0).
  - From kageru.moe blog: Inverse kernels (e.g., Debilinear) reverse the upscale if exact res/kernel known.
  - Warnings: Studios may apply post-processing (sharpening, grain) after upscale, complicating reversal.

- **Artifacts and Challenges**:
  - Ringing/Aliasing: From wrong res/kernel (e.g., debilinearizing 1080p native).
  - Mixed Resolutions: Layers (backgrounds vs. characters) at different res; 1080p overlays (credits/text) cause artifacts—use masks.
  - Subsampling: BD uses 4:2:0; descaling can convert to 4:4:4 for better chroma.
  - Bad Sources: Heavy grain, blur, compression, or simulcasts make descaling destructive.
  - From encode.moe and silentaperture guides: Descaling isn't always viable; treat as anti-artifact filter if imperfect.

- **Theoretical Foundations** (from kbz12.pdf):
  - Resizing: Weighted average of n reference pixels (e.g., n=1 for nearest neighbor, n=4 for cubic).
  - Inversion: Deterministic kernels (non-neural) can be reversed via linear equations (A*x = b, solve for x).
  - Neural Upscales (e.g., NNEDI3, waifu2x): Harder to invert; not covered deeply.

#### 2. Methods for Finding Native Resolutions
Two primary approaches, evolving from manual to automated:

- **Fourier Transforms**:
  - Analyze frequency domain: Upscales lack high frequencies (fine details).
  - Used by Anibin blog: Transforms images; absence of high freq indicates upscale. Examples show graphs (native 1080p has even freq distribution; SD upscale has cutoff).
  - From kbz12.pdf: Fast but can't detect multiple res per frame.

- **Error Measurements (Trial-and-Error)**:
  - Descale to possible res, upscale back, compute difference (lower error = better match).
  - From kbz12.pdf: VapourSynth example: `get_error` function computes absolute diff, plane stats.
  - Modern tools automate this with graphs (Y-axis: relative error; X-axis: res). Look for low-error spikes.
  - Fractional Support: For odd sizes (e.g., due to 1088p upscale/crop), tools search fractional src_height.

- **Examples from Sources**:
  - Anibin: "K-On! Season 2" (715p eval, 1280x720 est); "Attack on Titan" (824p/857p eval).
  - encode.moe: Manaria Friends (878p via graph); bad graphs (Miru Tights, no clear spikes).
  - silentaperture: Nichijou (720p bilinear).
  - kageru.moe: Non Non Biyori Repeat (846p, ringing if wrong res).

| Method | Pros | Cons | Tools/Examples |
|--------|------|------|---------------|
| Fourier | Fast, visual (graphs) | Misses multi-res; geo-tagged rare | Anibin (Japanese blog); kbz12.pdf figs (native vs. upscale freq) |
| Error Meas. | Accurate for multi-res; automated graphs | Slower; needs good frames (bright, clean) | getnative (graphs); GetFnative (fractional search) |

#### 3. Descaling Process and Tools
- **Workflow**:
  1. Select clean frame (bright, minimal effects/grain).
  2. Find res/kernel (tools below).
  3. Descale (e.g., VapourSynth: `core.descale.Debicubic(y, width, height, b=0, c=1)`).
  4. Mask artifacts/1080p elements (e.g., diff source vs. descale-upscale; merge with spline downscale).
  5. Handle chroma: Upscale to match luma for 4:4:4.
  6. Verify: Upscale back, compare; fix bad cases with AA (e.g., EEDI3).

- **Key Tools** (from GitHub browses):
  - **getnative** (Infiziert90): Python; error minimization with graphs. Supports bicubic (b/c params), lanczos. Install: pip; Usage: `python getnative.py image.png -k bicubic -b 0 -c 1`. Examples: 873p guess with graph/text output.
  - **GetFnative** (YomikoR): Fractional res search (e.g., 719.8p). Usage: `python -m getfnative script.vpy -bh 864 -f 1001`. Unique: Crop handling, parity checks; quick version (getfnativeq).
  - **getfscaler** (Jaded-Encoding-Thaumaturgy): Scaler detection with frac support. Features: Post-filtering for dither/edges, cross-conversion. Usage: `python getfscaler "image.png" -nh 810`. Compares to original getscaler: More robust, avoids ffms2 issues.
  - **resdet** (0x09): C tool/library; freq domain (DCT zero-crossings). Usage: `resdet resized.png` (guesses 512x512 from 768x768). Dependencies: libpng/jpeg, FFTW. Examples: With ImageMagick for colorspace.
  - **VapourSynth Plugins**: descale (Irrational-Encoding-Wizardry); fmtc for resampling. Wrappers: inverse_scale (kagefunc), MaskDetail.
  - **Avisynth**: Debilinear/Debicubic scripts (from kageru.moe).

- **Scripts/Examples**:
  - kageru.moe: Importable VapourSynth for bilinearM (masks, 4:4:4): `out = deb.debilinearM(src, 1280, 720, kernel='bicubic')`.
  - encode.moe: Comparison kernels on Manaria Friends frame; mask for Kaguya-sama credits.
  - silentaperture: Nichijou descale vs. spline36.

#### 4. Evolution and Consistency Across Sources
- **Early Sources (2010s)**: kageru.moe (legacy, pre-2017) and kbz12.pdf (2017 unfinished) focus on basics: Manual Avisynth/VapourSynth scripting, Anibin for res lookup, simple masks. Emphasis on bilinear/bicubic; warns against upscaling with inverse kernels.
- **Mid-2010s Anibin**: Manual Fourier analysis; explains fractional res from 1088p upscale/crop (consistent across sources).
- **Modern Guides/Tools (2020s)**: encode.moe and silentaperture (post-2020) integrate tools like getnative/descale; stress visual checks, masks for credits. GitHub tools add automation, fractional support (e.g., GetFnative for odd sizes like Anibin's 955.5p).
- **Consistency**: All agree on kernels (bilinear common), error/Fourier methods, masks for artifacts. Evolution: From manual (error-prone) to tools with graphs/fractionals. Warnings uniform: Verify visually; avoid on bad sources.
- **Differences**: Old sources use Avisynth heavily; modern favor VapourSynth. Tools like resdet add freq focus; getfscaler emphasizes professional kernels.

#### 5. Practical Tips and Warnings
- **Best Practices**: Use Blu-ray sources; test multiple frames/kernels; mask credits (e.g., inverse_scale with mask_detail=True). For bad descaling: EEDI3 AA or skip.
- **Pitfalls**: Dark/grainy frames give bad graphs; native 1080p undetectable by tools (go by gut). Fractional res common (Anibin); don't release odd res like 873p (leechers ignore).
- **Resources**: Anibin for lookups (Kanji titles via MAL/AniDB); VapourSynth Database for plugins.
- **Claims**: Descaling can improve quality but isn't magic—substantiated by examples showing reduced artifacts/filesize.
